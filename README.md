# Summation

## Purpose

This project is being written as the initial step in a multi-day effort to build an [*Reverse Polish Notation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)(RPN) calculator that takes input 
from the command line. 

This will eventually support the following post-fix operators:

+ Addition
+ Subtraction
+ Multiplication
+ Division
+ Exponentiation 
+ Modular Division

Development will follow these steps:

1. Read input from command line (complete).
2. Distinguish operands and operators.
3. Implement stack interpreter.
